Project Plan

Automated Revolving Loan Fund Prototype

This mini-research umbrella is composed of three distinct projects that are proving out the idea of an automated loan fund as an example service an automated business entity can provide.

Project Plan Format

Projects operating under this umbrella generally use the following formats for project plans:

Overview: Purpose and Intended Outcomes

The purpose of this project is to rapidly prototype an "Automated Revolving Loan Fund" and do a small-test at MIT at the end of 2016 and a field test in the DR early 2017.

Intended outcomes are to have We hope that  support 2 out of 5 groups living on the border.







Key Use Case 01:
Hypothesis

We Will Build

We Know We Have Succeeded When

Use Case N:

Project Partners and Roles
Project Milestones
Launch of the Proposed Project

Agree to Project Plan

Kick-Off Event to Commence the Formal Phase of the Project

Conduct Initial PoC Test

This phase follows a mini-project plan with start, middle and end. By achieving each step of this mini-plan, by definition, results with the successful completion of the project proof of concept.
Midproject Review and Feedback

Review of Prototype Test Plan
x
Conduct and Complete the Prototype Test - Incorporate by reference the Loan Hack PoC plan into the PoC for field test plan - by writing This whole project plan for local proof of concept as PoC - I will have experience in writing a project plan for longer period of time. I will have experience of having done it

This phase like the PoC also follows a mini-project plan with start, middle and end.
