1 Origination of loans (scientific method) - hypotheses driven prototyping (how to make this less) 
- How might we reduce managerial and operational cost in origination?
- How might we reduce the operation and management cost (staff, assistant) /the spread to reduce interest rates?
- How might we educate people to pay their loan and manage these loans? 
- How might we help people monitor small loans for small business? - Financial literacy and business training. 

2 Disbursement

   - cash 
   - card to use POS

3 Collection
- How may we be able to collect data for each phase - where or how to get to individuals 


4 Recovery
