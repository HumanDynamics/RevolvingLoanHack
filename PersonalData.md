The following minimum set of personal data fields is sufficient to satisfy a valid demo of the concept for an automated loan fund that is optimized to show how a "new deal on data" would work as the basis of a legitimate access to individual identity and private information that is fundamentally controlled by the people it is about:

## From OAuth 2 (FB and Google)
* First & Last Name
* EMail
* Source of Data

## From user input
* Address
* Income
* Amount of loan request (pull down menu $250, $500, $1,000, $2,500, $5,000)
* Check box: I agree to share this personal data for purpose of risk assessment to provide me a loan"
