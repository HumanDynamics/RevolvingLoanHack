Analytics and Blockchains for Mission-Driven Financial Institutions
October 18th, 2016 from 10:30am - 4:00pm
 
Roundtable Discussion at the MIT Media Lab
20 Ames Street, Cambridge MA; E14-240
 
Convened by Professor Alex "Sandy" Pentland at the MIT Media Lab, this event provides an opportunity for a small group of invited stakeholders, innovators and thought leaders to explore the transformative potential of analytics and blockchains for mission-driven financial institutions. 
 
MIT Professor Pentland will open the event by framing key issues, ideas and questions, followed by a handful of topic-centered sessions with individuals from the Human Dynamics Research Group.
 
Discussion sessions will be built around scenarios and vignettes highlighting key business, legal and technical "new value hypotheses" arising out of these emerging technologies. "Firestarter" discussion leaders will describe a scenario or vignette containing a hypothesis of new potential value available from the emerging technology to help catalyze discussion of each key topic.  
 
Scenarios under development include: 
 
•       Crypto-Solar Security Hypothesis
•       Bond in Box Hypothesis
•       Blockchain Border Bank Hypothesis
•       Self-Issued Blockchain Identity Hypothesis
•       Loan Origination & Servicing Hypothesis
•       Official Digital Public Registry Hypothesis
 
The discussion will explore implications of these emerging technologies for lending practices, operations and success measures in two primary mission-focused contexts: 
 
1)      Economic development, anchored by the Inter-American Development Bank
2)      Community-focused financial services, anchored by US based Credit Unions.  
 
The final hour of discussion will focus on effective tools, best practices and example models for harnessing innovation to explore, test, adapt and adopt these emerging technologies. The formal sessions will conclude with wrap up remarks by Professor Pentland at 4:15pm.

Dinner Reception Invitation: 
 
Attendees are invited to continue the conversations that evening at an optional social dinner at a local venue, to be decided and announced at the close of the day. 
 
Immediately following the event (4:30-5:30), attendees are invited to an optional reception a short walk from MIT Media Lab at the Cambridge Innovation Center (tentatively sponsored by PwC) for demonstrations of relevant blockchain and analytics technologies and networking with "civic hackers" who volunteer with organizations like yours to rapidly develop projects with open source and open standards on GitHub (Code for America and Legal Hackers volunteers are excited to meet you!).
