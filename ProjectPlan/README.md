# More Detail

## Launch of the Proposed Project
* Project Launch- Sept 15th: Develop draft [Project Plan](https://github.com/HumanDynamics/RevolvingLoanHack/blob/master/ProjectPlan/ProjectPlan.md)

## Kick-Off Meeting/Event to Commence the Formal Phase of the Project: October 17
* This is a meeting at which the key project principals discuss and agree to (or amend and then agree to) the Project Plan and calendar in key dates they will be involved with for the project. 
* Meeting Agenda (to be linked soon)
* Meeting Attendees (to be linked soon)
* Meeting Date (tbd)

## Date Range (Nov?) Deliver PoC Test Plan for Review/Comment
Conduct and Complete the Prototype Test. This phase like the PoC also follows a mini-project plan with start, middle and end.

## Date Range (Nov?) Run-Through of the Planned Working PoC for Review/Comment

* This is a dress rehersal and full walk through of what we expect to do.  This can be with the project team playing the roles of others or with the others themselves.  Idea is to ensure all the components are set up or can be set up and will work and that the data and actions expected are realistic and have been through through and will work and will creates the results expected to prove or disprove the hypothesis.

## (Nov?) Midproject Review and Feedback
Project progress shown and any issues addressed. This will feature what happened during the run through and should show clear path to final deliverable and be able to provide sufficient basis to raise any major questions or issues before completing work on Final Project Deliverable. 

## DATE RANGE (First Week Dec?) Conduct Initial PoC Test

This phase follows a mini-project plan with start, middle and end. This mini-project plan reflects the feedback received from the mid-project review.  This is the point of a mid-project review and is intended to increase the chances of success for the project success.  By achieving each step of this mini-plan, by definition, results with the successful completion of the project proof of concept.

## (Second week of Dec?) Compete Write up of PoC Test and Deliver for review/comment

* Can be merged with final presentation (below) in this case, as PoC is small event. 

## (Second week of Dec?) Final Project Presentation and Discussion
