## Date Range (Nov?) Deliver PoC Test Plan for Review/Comment
Conduct and Complete the Prototype Test. This phase like the PoC also follows a mini-project plan with start, middle and end.

## Date Range (Nov?) Demo the Scaffold or Initial Working PoC for Review/Comment

## (Nov?) Midproject Review and Feedback
Project progress shown and any issues addressed. Should show clear path to final deliverable and be able to provide sufficient basis to raise any major questions or issues before completing work on Final Project Deliverable. 

## DATE RANGE (First Week Dec?) Conduct Initial PoC Test

This phase follows a mini-project plan with start, middle and end. By achieving each step of this mini-plan, by definition, results with the successful completion of the project proof of concept.
