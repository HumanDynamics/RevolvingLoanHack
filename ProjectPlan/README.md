## Project Plan

# Automated Revolving Loan Fund Prototype

This mini-research umbrella is composed of three distinct projects that are proving out the idea of an automated loan fund as an example service an automated business entity can provide.

# Project Plan Format

Projects operating under this umbrella generally use the following formats for project plans:

# Overview: Purpose and Intended Outcomes

The purpose of this project is to rapidly prototype an "Automated Revolving Loan Fund" and do a small-test at MIT at the end of 2016 and a field test in the DR early 2017. The final product will be tested with 2 out of 5 groups living on the border.

# Link to Use Cases 
Key Use Case 01: MIT 2016 

# Hypothesis

We believe that we can build an an initial rapid prototype and proof of concept test for the "Automated Loan Fund" to be completed and tested at MIT at the end of 2016 with a small number of participants/users. 
We will proto
We will know our hypothesis is valid when we are able to originate loans and  a functioning automated workflow process.

# Use Case N:

# Project Partners and Roles
We use a [private Wiki page](https://github.com/CIVICS/BorderBank-Board/wiki/Border-Bank---Partners-Volunteer-Roles) for the current email list of project contributors. Project leads are eligible to have a [public profile page](https://github.com/HumanDynamics/law.MIT.edu/tree/gh-pages/people) as a token of attribution and recognition of their contributions to this open source project.

# Launch of the Proposed Project
* September 15th 

# Kick-Off Meeting/Event to Commence the Formal Phase of the Project: October 17
* Agree to Project Plan (1 page Poc) and Agenda

# Conduct Initial PoC Test

This phase follows a mini-project plan with start, middle and end. By achieving each step of this mini-plan, by definition, results with the successful completion of the project proof of concept.

# Midproject Review and Feedback
Project progress shown and any issues addressed. Should show clear path to final deliverable and be able to provide sufficient basis to raise any major questions or issues before completing work on Final Project Deliverable. 

# Review of Prototype Test Plan
Conduct and Complete the Prototype Test. This phase like the PoC also follows a mini-project plan with start, middle and end.

# Final Project Presentation and Discussion
Final project deliverable presentation
