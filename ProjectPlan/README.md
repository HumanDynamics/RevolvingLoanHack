## Project Plan

# "Blockchain Border Bank Loan Fund"

This project has two phases that will happen at MIT and in the Dominican Republic

# Project Plan Format

This format will be similar to the Automated Legal Entity format 

# Overview: Purpose and Intended Outcomes

The purpose of this project is to rapidly prototype an "Automated Loan Fund" and do a small-test at MIT at the end of 2016 and a field test in the DR early 2017. The final product will be tested with 2 out of 5 groups living on the border.
