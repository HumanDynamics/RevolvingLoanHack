# Economic Independence on the Haiti/DR Border

## Research Objective
To find and test the appropriate tools and technology to capture personal / financial data; to enable communities to use data as an economic asset for securing better financial products and services. 


## Sovereign Identity
We want to provide reliable identity for individuals as the first step to economic independence.

Working with encryption technology and trust networks we will ensure that communities own and control their own personal data (credit and transaction history). 
Abstract

We are prototyping a data, analytics and blockchain for refugee savings groups to improve financial services, promote greater financial inclusion and combat economic instability on the Haiti/DR border.

Our hope is to build an open source product that best fits the needs of Community Banks and Savings Circles. We believe that helping individuals create digital (self sovereign) identity, we will begin to have a better idea of how to better serve and  include the 2.5 billion individuals who do not have access to financial services.
