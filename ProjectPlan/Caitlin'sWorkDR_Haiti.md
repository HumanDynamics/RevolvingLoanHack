**Project Manager Civil Innovation Lab**

* **Puentes de Encuentro—Pon Randevou-Bridges of Encountero**
Caitlin led a group of Dominican university students, architects and Dominican and Haitian programmers in a joint collaboration to change the disconnect between the perceived reality of the border regions of the Dominican Republic and Haiti and what actually happens there by bridging the humanities and the arts through exposing real stories through engaging sensorial and cultural experiences.

* **Border Kites Youth Entrepreneurship**
Inspired by the Taking Kites Project, Caitlin worked with and documented Haitian and Dominican elementary school students at the border making kites and flying them to represent the good relationships between Haitians and Dominicans. The students connected with participating schools in Washington and Santo Domingo.
After the first project students showed interest in making a kite business to sell their kites to the public as there is no places in Jimani that sells kites.

 * Use of internet and videos: the students learned to make new kite designs. 
 * Financial planning: the group worked on how to figure out costs and shipping materials from Santo Domingo and overall profits.
 * Lending materials: those who were interested in the business were able to lend materials to make their kite for a kite competition or to be sold in Jimaní. They signed their names in a book with the amount of materials loaned for payback after kites were sold. This was to inspire entrepreneurial spirit rather than donations.
 
* **Alternative Energy and Innovation Experiment to Measure Carbon Inefficiencies**
As part of the CIV Civil Dialogue program Caitlin led a project to “create horizontal conversations among unexpected and unlikely peers.” She brought a select group of partners from environmental, social, community and innovative organization carried out a scientific experiment to measure the inefficiencies of charcoal production. The scientific experiment was followed up by the planting of 16 avocado and mango trees, and the weekend also included hands on workshops, yoga, dance and film.
