# Use Case 01: Fully Automated Workflow and Approval Chains for Loan Fund Entity and Operations

## Hypothesis

We hypothesize that we can build an an initial rapid prototype and proof of concept test for the "Automated Loan Fund" to be completed and tested at MIT at the end of 2016 with a small number of participants/users. 

## We Will Build

We will build a proof of concept demonstrating a single process and code base that when taken all together comprise the entirety of a loan fund.

Specifically, this is envisioned to include all business, legal and technical artifacts and actions that:
* create the legal entity that will hold the bank account in which the funds (probably Delaware corp using Valcu) and the Loan Fund operational system for applications, 
* review and decision (approval or rejection), 
* contract for loan, making disbursal, 
* receiving and sending receipts for individual loan payment and sending formal notice that the loan is fully repaid and the debt is discharged upon clearing final payment, 
* providing pre-populated agenda for loan committee decision to approve or reject applications, and 

## We will Know We Succeeded When
We will know our hypothesis is proven when we are able to [placeholder: originate loans and  a functioning automated workflow process].


# Use Case 02 Blend permissioned personal data and traditional loan application information for better creditworthiness assessment

# Use Case 03 

Space

We believe personal data will enable 75 more coop members to gain access to credit than otherwise could
Testing personal data such as regular habits/behavior will provide credit scoring information needed
To know that success in repayment is x% linked to these variables

Personal data / alternative criteria to test for credit scoring : Church attendance, COTEDEMI attendence, residential stability, payment consistency of microfinanced products, utility payment consistency, proving asset ownership,

Testing with different COTEDEMI members will provide insight into whether or not criteria is reliable for loan distribution. We will know that we have succedded if we see that x% of COTEDEMI members show a positive and consistent loan repyament based on this alternative criteria.

Format 2:
If ____,
then ____,
because ____.
Space

If COTEDEMI members show positive/consistent loan repaymet based on critera being tested

Then criteria can be considered for future loan

Because we will have something to base our assumptions on

Format 3:
We believe that [Hypothesis]
We will do/make [Test]
We will know the hypothesis is valid if by [Date]
We get [Evidence: quantitative measurable outcomes] or
We get [Evidence: qualitative observable outcome]
Space

We believe that there is a correlation between routine habits/behavioral patters and creditworthiness / repayment of loans.
We will do rapid prototyping to test alternative indicators for creditworthiness.
We will be doing rapid prototyping in the Dominican Republic/Haiti border.
We will know our hypothesis is valid when have gathered x number of participants as part of the testing
We will get x measurable outcome and x observable outcome
