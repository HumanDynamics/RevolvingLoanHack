# Use Case 01: Fully Automated Workflow and Approval Chains for Loan Fund Entity and Operations

## Hypothesis

We hypothesize that we can build an an initial rapid prototype and proof of concept test for the "Automated Loan Fund" to be completed and tested at MIT at the end of 2016 with a small number of participants/users. 

## We Will Build

We will build a proof of concept demonstrating a single process and code base that when taken all together comprise the entirety of a loan fund.

Specifically, this is envisioned to include all business, legal and technical artifacts and actions that:
* create the legal entity that will hold the bank account in which the funds (probably Delaware corp using Valcu) and the Loan Fund operational system for applications, 
* review and decision (approval or rejection), 
* contract for loan, making disbursal, 
* receiving and sending receipts for individual loan payment and sending formal notice that the loan is fully repaid and the debt is discharged upon clearing final payment, 
* providing pre-populated agenda for loan committee decision to approve or reject applications, and 

## We will Know We Succeeded When
We will know our hypothesis is proven when we are able to [placeholder: originate loans and  a functioning automated workflow process].
