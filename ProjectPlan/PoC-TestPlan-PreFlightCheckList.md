# Step 1: Define
* Organize initiative team, owners, and any key stakeholders
* Collectively define goals, inputs, objectives, scope, and success criteria
* Establish resource commitments and finalize a POC schedule
* Deliverables in the ‘Define’ phase should include: detailed POC Scope and Plan Documentation, Success Criteria, and a POC Schedule
 
# Step 2: Develop
* Create POC-specific use cases for minimal but necessary functionalities within the POC scope (for proof of capability initiatives, align use cases to each capability in scope)
* Work with stakeholders to prioritize functionalities across the use cases
* Deliverables in the ‘Develop’ phase should include: Use Cases, Success Criteria (revised based on preliminary findings throughout this process step)
 
# Step 3: Engineer
* Configure and test the required infrastructure and software, and test to replicate the operational environment
* Define solution steps for use cases and implement the POC solution build
* Deliverables in the ‘Engineer’ phase should include: Solution Design, Implementation Plan, Success Criteria (revised again based on latest findings)
 
# Step 4: Execute
* Create test design for use cases and define positive/negative test scenarios
* Design and execute test scripts while recording results and information on failed or skipped tests or test case steps
* Deliverables in the ‘Execute’ phase should include: Test Cases, Test Scripts, and Test Results
 
# Step 5: Evaluate
* Review and validate the POC results with all stakeholders
* Compare outcomes to success criteria in order to develop findings summary and present a lessons learned
* Gain alignment on a ‘move forward’ decision and develop full execution plan
* Deliverables in the ‘Evaluate’ phase should include: Evaluation Model, Finding Summary (w/ Lessons Learned), and an Execution Plan (if applicable)
