POC is designed to demonstrate feasibility of a proposed idea or concept to solve a business need. It helps identify potential technical and logistical issues which could interfere with meeting success criteria but also provides an opportunity to gather feedback on the product/service while mitigating risk by providing decision choices early on in a development cycle.
 
While this TIP focuses on the core framework (activities, deliverables, and considerations) necessary to perform a successful POC, it also encourages readers to place additional thought in Proof of Capability, a lesser used term, but equally important when trying to focus attention on the feasibility of specific capabilities within an approved or already successful concept. Knowing a client’s needs and expectations surrounding a POC will help identify whether a proof of concept or a proof of capability discussion is more relevant and which should be used to gain traction in a vendor selection process. The methodology outlined below has been developed for either POC method. 

# Step 1: Define
* Organize initiative team, owners, and any key stakeholders
* Collectively define goals, inputs, objectives, scope, and success criteria
* Establish resource commitments and finalize a POC schedule
* Deliverables in the ‘Define’ phase should include: detailed POC Scope and Plan Documentation, Success Criteria, and a POC Schedule
 
# Step 2: Develop
* Create POC-specific use cases for minimal but necessary functionalities within the POC scope (for proof of capability initiatives, align use cases to each capability in scope)
* Work with stakeholders to prioritize functionalities across the use cases
* Deliverables in the ‘Develop’ phase should include: Use Cases, Success Criteria (revised based on preliminary findings throughout this process step)
 
# Step 3: Engineer
* Configure and test the required infrastructure and software, and test to replicate the operational environment
* Define solution steps for use cases and implement the POC solution build
* Deliverables in the ‘Engineer’ phase should include: Solution Design, Implementation Plan, Success Criteria (revised again based on latest findings)
 
# Step 4: Execute
* Create test design for use cases and define positive/negative test scenarios
* Design and execute test scripts while recording results and information on failed or skipped tests or test case steps
* Deliverables in the ‘Execute’ phase should include: Test Cases, Test Scripts, and Test Results
 
# Step 5: Evaluate
* Review and validate the POC results with all stakeholders
* Compare outcomes to success criteria in order to develop findings summary and present a lessons learned
* Gain alignment on a ‘move forward’ decision and develop full execution plan
* Deliverables in the ‘Evaluate’ phase should include: Evaluation Model, Finding Summary (w/ Lessons Learned), and an Execution Plan (if applicable)

# Technical 

Proof of concept is a term with various interpretations in different areas. POC in software development describes distinct processes with different objectives and participant roles. POC may also refer to partial solutions involving a small number of users acting in business roles to establish whether a system satisfies certain requirements. The overall objective of POC is to find solutions to technical problems, such as how systems can be integrated or throughput can be achieved through a given configuration.

# Business

In the business world, POC is how startups demonstrate that a product is financially viable. POC involves extensive research and review and is submitted as a single package to concerned parties. It includes examination of the revenue model, in which companies show projected revenue from products and services, and indicate development cost, long-term finance projections and how much the service costs to maintain and market. It is an excellent way for a business to evaluate itself internally and at proposed acquisitions and projects
