* Needs: Summary of Data Robot functionality

* Need: Parts of the API needed to take data from loan applications and to deliver results of Data Robot analytics into loan application processing workflow and approval chain

* Need: Links to the key Lending Tree data and analytics Data Robot performed to identify "good" and "bad" loan applications for purposes of loan application approval or rejection

## Check out Evue

* According to person at the company we met at a hackathon: EVUE is an open-source modular container / framework, similar to Docker, for distributed information auditing across instances of trust networks. This is an implementation of a Gartner award winning system I designed for the electric utility industry. It was adopted by NERC as the only qualified method for continuous auditing they would accept for automated certification of machine produced criterion.
