## Evaluate Typeform

https://admin.typeform.com/form/2416373/fields/

Given the API used by TypeForm and the simple/easy user interface, is this tool potentially as good or better than Google Form as a form-driven user input for project processes and also for the automataed loan fund to be tested? 

Evaluation should explore whether/how this TypeForm can be used as input for Loan Application process and also for other key user actions such as creation of Valcu-driven legal entity and for loan officer to write information onto the loan record and communication to applicants or borrower?  


## Evaluation of Data Robot

This is definitely something we want to try using if it is within our reach technically and does not cost anything or cost too much to use for this purpose. 

* Needs: Summary of Data Robot functionality

* Need: Parts of the API needed to take data from loan applications and to deliver results of Data Robot analytics into loan application processing workflow and approval chain

* Need: Links to the key Lending Tree data and analytics Data Robot performed to identify "good" and "bad" loan applications for purposes of loan application approval or rejection

## Check out Evue

* According to person at the company we met at a hackathon: EVUE is an open-source modular container / framework, similar to Docker, for distributed information auditing across instances of trust networks. This is an implementation of a Gartner award winning system I designed for the electric utility industry. It was adopted by NERC as the only qualified method for continuous auditing they would accept for automated certification of machine produced criterion.
