POC is designed to demonstrate feasibility of a proposed idea or concept to solve a business need. It helps identify potential technical and logistical issues which could interfere with meeting success criteria but also provides an opportunity to gather feedback on the product/service while mitigating risk by providing decision choices early on in a development cycle.

While this TIP focuses on the core framework (activities, deliverables, and considerations) necessary to perform a successful POC, it also encourages readers to place additional thought in Proof of Capability, a lesser used term, but equally important when trying to focus attention on the feasibility of specific capabilities within an approved or already successful concept. Knowing a clientâ€™s needs and expectations surrounding a POC will help identify whether a proof of concept or a proof of capability discussion is more relevant and which should be used to gain traction in a vendor selection process. The methodology outlined below has been developed for either POC method.


# Technical 

Proof of concept is a term with various interpretations in different areas. POC in software development describes distinct processes with different objectives and participant roles. POC may also refer to partial solutions involving a small number of users acting in business roles to establish whether a system satisfies certain requirements. The overall objective of POC is to find solutions to technical problems, such as how systems can be integrated or throughput can be achieved through a given configuration.

# Business

In the business world, POC is how startups demonstrate that a product is financially viable. POC involves extensive research and review and is submitted as a single package to concerned parties. It includes examination of the revenue model, in which companies show projected revenue from products and services, and indicate development cost, long-term finance projections and how much the service costs to maintain and market. It is an excellent way for a business to evaluate itself internally and at proposed acquisitions and projects
