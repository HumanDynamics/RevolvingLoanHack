Our PoC is designed to demonstrate the feasibility of an Automated Loan Fund. The purpose of this doc is to confront any technical and logistical issues to mitigate risk - providing decision choices for supervisors, industry professionals to answer early on in the development cycle.

Test goals are to rapidly prototype an "Automated Loan Fund" with a small-test at MIT at the end of 2016 following a 4-8 week field test (full lifecycle) model in the DR early 2017. The final product will be tested with 2 out of 5 groups living on the border. See project README file for relevant dates and milestones. https://github.com/HumanDynamics/RevolvingLoanHack/blob/master/ProjectPlan/README.md
