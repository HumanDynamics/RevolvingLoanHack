# "Automated Loan Fund Proof of Concept"

This project has two phases that will happen at MIT and a second phase, if successfull that will include prototype testing in the Dominican Republic and further testing at MIT and perhaps other locations (North Dakota, etc).

# Overview: Purpose and Intended Outcomes

The purpose of this project is to rapidly prototype an "Automated Loan Fund" and do a small-test at MIT at the end of 2016 and a field test in the DR early 2017. The final product will be tested with 2 out of 5 groups living on the border.
