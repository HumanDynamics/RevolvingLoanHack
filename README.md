**Automated Revolving Loan Fund Prototype**

The automated loan fund is a law.MIT.edu open source project desiged as an example service that an automated business entity can provide.

* **Slack**: The slack team for this project is: https://opencollab.slack.com
* **For More Information**: For more information, contact us here: http://law.mit.edu/contact

* **3 Part Initial Design Pattern**:  The first part is to create a reference implementation loan fund spreadsheet and the second part is to integrate blockchain technology for a) identity (eg: Blockstack/Microsoft, uPort/ConsenSys, BanQu, etc), b) enter hash of key event onto blockchain (eg loan disbursal to borrower, loan installemnt payent to lender, loan default notice to borrower, etc), and the third part is to model an overlay of loan fund spread sheet and smart contract rules whereby collatoral is secured socially be members of a mutual credit group.

# Step 1: Loan Fund Spread Sheet

* A basic model using Google Sheets would be a good starting point. 

* **One Tab Per Borrower**  Start with idea of using one tab per borrower relating to the current accounts of each individual borrower; and
* **One Master tab relating to the current accounts of the overall fund**, namely: 
* Current accounting statements (the then current balance sheet and other core accounting statements, setup to be continuously updated).  

Note: The current accounting statements can be broken into multiple tabs if needed for usability and maintainability

Note: This may be migrated to a database (SQL, etc) sooner or later. 

# Step 2: Analytics and Blockchain Overlay

## Data Enabled Business Analytics and Reporting

In addition to real time and continuous accounting statements, add Master Tab's for:

* 1) Thomas' model and current view of the "spread" and other key elements he has shown us; and 

* 2) the core elements of Jason's model (w/r/t the min credit score needed for an applicant to receive a loan at any given time and the interest rates and other applicable terms and conditions accompanying loans, setup to be continuously updated).  


## Blockchain Propelled Identity, Evidence and Automation

* Self-Sourced Personal Identity, 

* Self-Authenticating Legal Evidence 

* Self-Executing Automated Transactions

such that a smart contract written in Solidity and prototyped on testnet for piloting with Mist wallets can be scaffolded out and prototyped.  


# Step 3: Mutual Credit Community Overlay

After completing the above, and extending the capabilities of the above, create additional or alternative tab(s) on the spreadsheet modeling a way for members of a saving circle community to guarentee one or more loans issued to one or more members of the circe; including:

* A way to uniquely identify and state a collateral security interest in assets (eg: reserve funds, escrowed funds, collateralized/secured house/car/equipment, other secured assets, etc) 
* The simplest, most common and rudimentary sequence of events constituting loan default and how they would be recorded in a Google sheet based upon objective events or confirmed "non-payment" events.

Note: Other Mutual Credit overlays could include a Time Bank or other methods of activating social capital.

# Timing and Milestones

## Initial "Hello World" Test

Week of Nov 7th: Hello World initial alpha test

## Life-Cycle Run Through

First week of December: Full life-cycle run through

## Hypothesis Testing

January IAP:  Business Value Hypothesis Tested via Loan/payback of "Real Money" with integrated "Real Accounting" and transacting through "Real Blockchain".  

## Field Testing

Based on how the preliminary and initial testing and prototying unfold, in the Feb-April time frame we hope to field test key elements of the technology in the live production domains including for the Blockchain Border Bank project in the Dominican Republic.
